    "description": "Introduction to some basics in geometric analysis through the discussions of two fundamental problems in geometry: the resolution of the Yamabe problem and the study of harmonic maps. The analytic aspects of these problems include Sobolev spaces, best constants in Sobolev inequalities, and regularity and a priori estimates of systems of elliptic PDE.",
