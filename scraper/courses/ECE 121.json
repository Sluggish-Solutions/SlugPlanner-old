    "description": "Focus is on the design and use of microcontroller-based embedded systems, specifically addressing issues of low-level functionality, direct manipulation of input/output using various specialized peripheral sets, and multiple communications protocols. Covers timers, Input Capture, Output Compare, ADC, PWM, interrupts, bus and memory organization, DMA, SPI, I2C, device driver programming, serial packet communication, and clocking. Students enrolled in this class learn how to use the C programming language to solve engineering problems.",
