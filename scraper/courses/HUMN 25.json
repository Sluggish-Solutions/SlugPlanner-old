    "title": "Humans and Machines: A History",
    "description": "Students learn how humans and machines have interacted, become intertwined, and opposed one another throughout history, from the paleolithic era to the present. By examining a variety of texts (theory, philosophy, theater, visual art, instruction manuals, films, advertisements, podcasts), students explore how machines can enable, inhibit, and control their users in a variety of contexts. Students also apply historically grounded knowledge to propose technological solutions to contemporary problems.",
