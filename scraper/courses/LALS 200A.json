    "description": "Examines historical processes and contemporary social, cultural, and political structures in the Americas. Explores power as a mesh that interweaves relations of exploitation/domination/conflict aimed at controlling different dimensions of social existence. Places particular emphasis on the nature of capitalist development in the Americas, colonialism, imperialism/anti-imperialism, nationalism/ transnationalism/ plurinationalism, and neoliberalism. Builds a contextual foundation for conceptual inquiry in the department?s four substantive themes. (Formerly Power and Society.)",
