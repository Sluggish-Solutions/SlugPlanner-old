    "title": "Computational Physics",
    "description": "This course applies efficient numerical methods to the solutions of problems in the physical sciences which are otherwise intractable. Examples will be drawn from classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and electrodynamics. Students apply a high-level programming language, such as Python, to the solution of physical problems and develop appropriate error and stability estimates.",
