No science background is required.Expanded Course Description:In this course, we will think critically and creatively together about the ways in which science as a practice and a way of knowing gives rise to particular and perhaps peculiar ways of experiencing bodies as individual, raced, gendered, and even 'specied'. We will explore a variety of issues in contemporary science and technology, with an emphasis on body and embodiment ? that is, ways of knowing and experiencing the body within and beyond science, and within and beyond race and gender",
