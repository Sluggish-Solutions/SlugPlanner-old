Examines music with sensitivity to such complexities of context, and the disciplinary points of reference from which cultural difference is calculated. Considers the ideological imprint of methodology on cultural analysis: how to study an unfamiliar music in a way that transcends the measure of  \"difference from the familiar,\" and, conversely, how to conduct an \"objective\" study of a familiar music.",
