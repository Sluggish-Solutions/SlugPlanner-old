    "description": "Introduces fundamental issues in sensing of temperature, motion, sound, light, position, etc. Sensors are integrated into a digital system using filtering, amplification, and analog-to-digital conversion. Advanced topics may include noise, temperature, and other sources of variability. Students who enrolled in this class will learn how to solve engineering problems using the C Programming Language.",
