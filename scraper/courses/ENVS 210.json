It has a dual purpose: First, to develop a contemporary historical understanding and sensibility of how economic change, new institutional configurations, and world scale processes are shaping interactions with the environment. Second, to examine some recent political social theoretical perspectives on nature-society relations and radical environmental and social movements.",
