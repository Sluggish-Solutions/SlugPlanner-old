    "description": "Explores the entanglements of histories, genders and archives across a number of intellectual and imperial contexts. Our inquiry approaches the concept of the archive to reflect on who counts as a historical and/or gendered subject and what are the ethics of representation that guide such archival formations. In approaching these questions, students draw on literature from the disciplines of philosophy, gender/sexuality studies, anthropology, history, and literary criticism. May be repeated for credit.",
