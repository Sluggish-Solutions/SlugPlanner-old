    "description": "Teaches the art and science of dramaturgy. Dramaturgy refers to the accumulated techniques that all theatrical artists employ to determine the aesthetic architecture of a piece of dramatic literature; discover everything needed to transform the inert script into a living performance; and apply that knowledge in a way that makes sense to an audience. Prerequisite THEA 160 may be used to satisfy a theater arts minor requirement. THEA 160 is typically taken in junior year but may be taken earlier if a student feels ready and wants to be able to take THEA 161 earlier. Taking both classes best prepares students to undertake dramaturgical work on theatrical productions.",
