    "description": "Picks up where the fall capstone planning seminar ended. Students continue designing capstone project for pursuing a scalable solution to a complex and pressing coastal sustainability problem. Winter focus is learning and applying strategies and methods to: (a) co-create a capstone project with a non-academic partner in the government, non-governmental or private sector; and (b) develop and submit successful funding proposals for the project. Methods learned apply broadly to collaborative, solutions-oriented work that may be pursued after graduation. Weekly assignments mean working outside of class on steps or skills for co-creating and fundraising with partners and then sharing work for peer-review in class in the next week. Expect to do the reading and weekly assignments before each week's seminar session. Instructor provides separate instructions for weekly assignments.",
