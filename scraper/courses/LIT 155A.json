We will survey important film forms (narrative film, documentary, ethnographic film), international new waves/neo-realisms (Italy, Senegal, Taiwan, Argentina, Romania, and Iran), and genres in order to develop a nuanced sense of the kinds of sensoria, senses of self, and forms of spectatorship films have fostered, impeded, ignored, or anticipated over the past century. <<<<<< Lectures meet on Tuesdays from 5:20 to 6:55 PM and on Thursdays from 7:10 to 8:45 PM. Likewise, there will be required weekly film screenings on Tuesdays starting at 7:10 PM . >>>>>>>",
