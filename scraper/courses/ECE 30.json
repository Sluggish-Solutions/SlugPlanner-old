    "description": "Suitable for sophomores pursuing computer science and engineering careers. Aims at deriving basic engineering principles directly from examples relevant to computing and electronics: 1) Newton's Laws and related fundamental mechanics; 2) basic thermodynamics and heat/energy transfer; 3) key electromagnetic principles, including Coulomb's Law, Gauss's Law, and basic circuit analysis using Kirchoff's Laws/Rules; and 4) Ray optics for fiber optic communications and camera electronics.",
