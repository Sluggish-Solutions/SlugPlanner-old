    "description": "An introduction to the basic techniques used in compiler design. Topics include compiler structure, symbol tables, regular expressions and languages, finite automata, lexical analysis, context-free languages, LL(1), recursive descent, LALR(1), and LR(1) parsing; and attribute grammars as a model of syntax-directed translation. Students use compiler building tools to construct a working compiler. (Formerly Computer  Science 104A.)",
