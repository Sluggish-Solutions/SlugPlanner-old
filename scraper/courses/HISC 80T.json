    "description": "What is the witch? A historical person? A vestige of pre-colonial European ancestry? A cultural object whose image and identity are shaped by film, paintings and literature. Class considers the witch's development in Europe. Also reviews the witch as a tool of racial, economic and social stratification in society. By looking at how the witch is represented through visual and literary culture, students develop an understanding of the witch as a historic symbol of shifting relations of gender, class and power.",
