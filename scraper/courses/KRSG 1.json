    "description": "Teaches foundational concepts for intellectual and personal development in an academic community: analysis, critical thinking, metacognition, engagement with others across difference, and self-efficacy. Focuses on the power of education and learning to imagine the world otherwise and to effect justice and social change. Texts address generational trajectories to college; the history of UCSC and the local region; family traditions of knowledge; and social movements that can inspire us. Students learn to read in different genres and formats and reflect on their reading practices.",
