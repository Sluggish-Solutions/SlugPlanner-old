    "description": "Students address a current scientific question about protein stability using structure-guided protein engineering. Specifically, Students use recombinant DNA technology to produce an engineered protein that is predicted to have enhanced stability. Students then assess its stability with differential scanning fluorimetry. Students are billed a materials fee of $140.",
