Remembering is a fundamentally social process. Topics include extended cognitive systems, conversational remembering, family reminiscence, how social networks shape how and what we remember, cognitive content biases supporting collective convergence, and the psychology of collective memory. This includes social representations of history and their biases, cultural tools for thought, intergenerational transmission, and collective future thought. Satisfies seminar requirement.
