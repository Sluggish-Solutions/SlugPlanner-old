    "title": "Applied Partial Differential Equations",
    "description": "Focuses on analytical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), including: the method of characteristics for first-order PDEs; canonical forms of linear second-order PDEs; separation of variables; Sturm-Liouville theory; Green's functions. Illustrates each method using applications taken from examples in physics. AM 211 or equivalent is strongly recommended as preparation. Students cannot receive credit for this course and AM 112.
