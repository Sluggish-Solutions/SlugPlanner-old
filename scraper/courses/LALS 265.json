    "description": "Graduate students in LALS and related fields discuss interdisciplinary texts on the interconnection between Latin American species and geographies. Takes a historically grounded approach to address a range of topics related to the study of non-human subjects in this hemisphere, such as animals, plants, fungi, and the ecologies that they co-constitute. Topics include: centering non-humans in Latin American history; critical natural histories of the hemisphere; and inhabiting, and producing knowledge about, nature in contemporary America. In addition, students choose their own related topic(s) of interest and complete a series of reflective and iterative writing assignments, culminating in a draft for (optional) future publication.",
