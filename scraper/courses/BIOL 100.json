    "description": "Introduction to biochemistry including biochemical molecules, protein structure and function, membranes, bioenergetics, and regulation of biosynthesis. Provides students with basic essentials of modern biochemistry and the background needed for upper-division biology courses. Students who desire a more in-depth exposure to biochemistry should consider taking the BIOC 100A/BIOC 100B/BIOC 100C series as an alternative. Students cannot receive credit for this course after they have completed the BIOC 100A, BIOC 100B, and BIOC 100C sequence.",
