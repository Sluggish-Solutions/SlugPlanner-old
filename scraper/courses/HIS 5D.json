    "description": "The phrase ''Religions of Abraham'' describes three religions?Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?that claim Abraham as chief patriarch. This course examines the formation of these diverse traditions chiefly through primary source material: literature, letters, and legal documents. The historical period of the ancient Near East from the height of the Babylonian Empire to the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate is covered, while students also learn about the variety of beliefs, texts, and practices that comprise these vibrant world religions.",
