    "description": "Introduces the theory and practice of natural language processing (NLP)--the creation of computer programs that can understand, generate, and learn natural language. Introduces the three major subfields of NLP: syntax (the structure of a sentence); semantics (the  explicit meaning of a single sentence); and pragmatics (the implicit meaning of a sentence when it is used in a specific discourse). Projects focus on the techniques useful for a particular application area, alternating in different years. Project application areas include information extraction, narrative understanding, sentiment analysis, dialogue systems, and question answering. (Formerly CMPS 143.)",
