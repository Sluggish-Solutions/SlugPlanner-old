    "description": "Overview of physical-biogeochemical interactions in the ocean and their impact on marine ecosystems, with a special focus on the California Current and other important marine biomes. Lectures introduce the fundamental processes occurring at regional (e.g., upwelling dynamics) and basin (e.g., El Ni?o events) scales, and describe how their interplay shapes the seasonal, interannual, and long-term response of marine ecosystems worldwide.",
