    "description": "Integrated musicianship, theory, and analysis. Diatonic harmony and fundamentals of chromatic harmony and musical form, with an emphasis on early 18th-century styles. Ear-training, taught in smaller sections, emphasizes recognition of triad and seventh-chord qualities and inversions, dictation of moderately complex melodies and multi-voice chorales, and aural analysis of chord progressions including secondary functions. Most of the ear-training materials consist of homophonic and polyphonic examples from music literature performed live in class. Prerequisite(s): MUSC  30A; instructor determination at first class meeting.",
