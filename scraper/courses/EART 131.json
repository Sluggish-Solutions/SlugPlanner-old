    "title": "Sea Level Change",
    "description": "From the origin of the oceans to the modern climate crisis, this course aims to explore sea-level change over a wide range of timescales. The course links a series of solid Earth processes, such as mantle convection, viscoelastic deformation, and plate tectonics, to the past climate record. Students investigate how these processes contribute to our understanding of past, present, and future changes in sea level and climate.",
