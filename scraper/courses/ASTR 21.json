Course introduces students to current topics and research in a astronomy and astrophysics, and gives students the background necessary for success in the 100-level Astrophysics laboratory classes (PHYS 135 or ASTR 136). Class focuses on three central types of objects in modern astronomy: stars, planets, and galaxies, building off of our nearest examples, the Sun, solar system planets, and the Milky Way. The class differs from GE classes like ASTR 2 in that a higher level of math and physics experience is assumed.",
