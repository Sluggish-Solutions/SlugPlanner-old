    "description": "Examines, and critically analyzes, select post-World War II movements for social justice in the United States from feminist perspectives. Considers how those movements and their participants responded to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality. A feminist, transnational, analytic framework is also developed to consider how those movements may have embraced, enhanced, or debilitated feminist formations in other parts of the world.",
