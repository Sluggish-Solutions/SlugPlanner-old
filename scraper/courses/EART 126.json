    "description": "An integration of rock mechanics, geophysics, fluid flow, and geology to quantify stress state in the subsurface. Covers a range of topics including: basic constitutive laws for stress and strain, tectonic stress fields, the effects of fluids on rock and fault strength, natural and human-induced hydrofracture, human-induced seismicity, fault, drilling techniques for determining subsurface physical rock properties, and fault zones drilling.",
