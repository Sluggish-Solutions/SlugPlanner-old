    "description": "Integrated musicianship, theory, and analysis. Chromatic harmony and large forms, with emphasis on late 18th- and early 19th-century styles. Ear-training, taught in smaller sections, emphasizes melodic and multi-voice dictation, as well as aural analysis of chord progressions, with materials including digressions, modulations, and advanced chromatic idioms. Most of the ear-training materials consist of homophonic and polyphonic examples from music literature performed live in class. Prerequisite(s): MUSC  30B; instructor determination at first class meeting.",
