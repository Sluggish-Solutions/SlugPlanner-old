    "description": "Gives students a solid foundation in a specific application area of natural language processing, by learning about the theories, methods, tools, and techniques typically used in this area. The application area varies each quarter, with expected topics to include Information Extraction, Question Answering, Natural Language Generation, Sentiment Analysis, and others. Students learn about the state of the art and open challenges, and have the opportunity to explore and experiment with both standard algorithms and new emerging approaches.\n May be repeated for credit.",
