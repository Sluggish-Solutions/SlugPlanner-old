In Media Constellations, we study the depth and breadth of media history, rather than its linear trajectory, treating old media as ?spaces of action? where we can generate new work. In addition to developing small, media-based projects, students will read and discuss theoretical and historical texts from the disciplines of media archaeology, platform/software studies, computer historiography, archival studies, and media philosophy. Our goal is to establish methodological and theoretical foundations in the practical, creative, and speculative study of media artifacts.",
